## Installing Git on Windows & Cloning the Repo

### Step 1: Download Git for Windows

Go to the official Git website:

ðŸ‘‰ [https://git-scm.com/download/win](https://git-scm.com/download/win)

The download should start automatically.

---

### Step 2: Install Git

Run the installer you downloaded.

**Important:** During setup, select the option  
**"Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software"**  
(This ensures Git works in CMD.)

You can accept the rest of the default options unless you have specific preferences.

---

### Step 3: Restart Command Prompt

After the installation finishes, **close and reopen your Command Prompt**  
so the Git command becomes available.

---

### Step 4: Clone the Repository

You can now clone the project using either HTTPS or SSH.

#### Clone via HTTPS (recommended unless you set up SSH keys):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/polsuarezm/AFC-DRL-experiment.git
